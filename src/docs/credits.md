  Without doubt this section is going to expand as additional features are added due to the number of great ideas and packages out there for Jetstream.

  ## Jetstream Turbo

  Jetstream Turbo stands on the shoulders of giants, its original objective was to improve the excellent [Team Transfer](https://github.com/joelbutcher/jetstream-team-transfer) package by [Joel Butcher](https://github.com/joelbutcher).
  
  I was looking to refactor the UI to be closer to Joel's [Jetstream Team Transfer PR](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream/pull/526), but during the process it became clear that without changing the scope of the package it wouldn't be possible.
